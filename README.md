#### 2. **Setup Instructions:**

#### **Prerequisites**:
- Node.js v16 or later
- Expo CLI
- A physical device or emulator for testing

#### **Installation**:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/expo/react-native-boilerplate.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-native-boilerplate`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`

#### **Configuration**:
- Update the `app.json` file with your app's name, description, and other relevant information.
- Configure your Expo environment by following the instructions in the Expo documentation.

#### **Environment Setup**:
- **Development**: Run `expo start` to start the development server.
- **Production**: Build the app for iOS or Android using `expo build` and follow the platform-specific instructions for deployment.

#### **First-Time Run**:
Open the app in a simulator or on a physical device. You should see a welcome screen with a button to navigate to the registration page.

#### 3. **Core Modules and Architecture:**

#### **Components**:
- **App Layout**: Defines the overall structure of the application.
- **Auth Screens**: Manages user authentication and registration.
- **Home Screen**: Displays a welcome message and registration button.
- **Themed Components**: Provides reusable and customizable UI elements.
- **Navigation**: Handles screen navigation and routing.

#### **Relationships**:
- The `App Layout` component wraps all other components and provides a consistent header and footer.
- The `Auth Screens` are accessible from the `Home Screen` and handle user authentication and registration.
- The `Home Screen` is the entry point of the application and displays a welcome message.
- The `Themed Components` are used throughout the application to maintain a consistent UI.
- The `Navigation` component manages the flow of screens and allows for easy navigation between them.

#### **Key Functionalities**:
- **User Authentication**: Allows users to register and log in.
- **Parallax Scrolling**: Provides a dynamic and immersive user experience.
- **Animated Components**: Adds interactivity and visual appeal to the UI.
- **Modular Architecture**: Enables code reusability and simplifies maintenance.

#### **Internal Architecture**:
The project follows a modular architecture, with each component responsible for a specific functionality. This approach promotes code reusability, simplifies maintenance, and facilitates collaboration.

#### 4. **API Endpoints**:

This project does not define any API endpoints as it is primarily focused on the frontend development of the mobile application.

#### 5. **Usage Examples:**

#### **Common Use Cases**:
- Building a mobile application with authentication and user management.
- Creating a visually appealing and interactive user interface.
- Developing a modular and maintainable codebase.

#### **Code Samples**:
Refer to the `app.tsx` file for an overview of the application's structure and components.

#### **Best Practices**:
- Follow the React Native best practices for code style, component design, and state management.
- Utilize TypeScript to enforce type safety and improve code quality.
- Implement unit tests to ensure the reliability and stability of your codebase.

#### **Tips and Tricks**:
- Use the Expo documentation as a valuable resource for troubleshooting and learning about Expo's features.
- Leverage the React Native community for support and collaboration.
- Stay up-to-date with the latest React Native and Expo releases for performance improvements and new features.
